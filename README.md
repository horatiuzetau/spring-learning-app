### Spring application with the purpouse of learning Hibernate and REST.

This is a simple application like a MarketPlace. It will have Products within Categories. The products belong to specific Brands found in specific Cities. It will also have Users and a Cart. The possibility to buy items, manage them and show them.
In the initial commit I already did the Product - Category part.

Althought this is an application to increase my Spring knowledge, it will also help me create a close relation to Git. I will use different branches for different features to really simulate a team developing process. 

The next feature that I want to add will be the Branding part. The products will belong to Brands and the Brands will be found in different cities. After that I will start with the User feature.

For the interface I think React will be my choice, but I am not convinced yet.

Two days ago I updated the market-feature branch. Now it contains Brands and Cities. I managed to create every request possible so I can get used to it and then I will keep the important ones.

I will go with the authentification system next. I'll make a different branch that does not include the market feature, so everything will be decoupled. I'll use Spring Security.
